# Generative 3D Audio Visualizer

An immersive, real-time 3D audio visualizer that brings your music to life. Built with React, Three.js, and the Web Audio API, this application transforms audio from local files or your microphone into a dynamic visual experience featuring a generative sphere and a starfield background.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Real-time 3D Visualization**: A central sphere dynamically distorts and pulses in response to audio frequencies (bass, mids, treble).
*   **Dual Audio Sources**: Use local audio files (MP3, WAV, etc.) or your computer's microphone as the input.
*   **Full Playlist Control**:
    *   Upload multiple files to create a playlist.
    *   Add more songs at any time.
    *   Remove songs with a single click.
    *   Reorder the playlist using intuitive drag-and-drop.
*   **Advanced Playback Controls**: Full control over your music with play/pause, next/previous track, a seekable progress bar, and volume adjustment.
*   **Deep Visual Customization**: Fine-tune the visuals through a comprehensive settings panel:
    *   **Color Palettes**: Choose from presets like Synthwave, Oceanic, Magma, and Forest.
    *   **Distortion & Motion**: Control the intensity of audio-reactive distortion and the fluid, organic motion of the sphere.
    *   **Bloom Effect**: Adjust the glow intensity for a more cinematic feel.
    *   **Rotation Speed**: Change how fast the camera orbits the sphere.
    *   **Pump Sensitivity**: Control how strongly the visuals react to beats.
*   **Collapsible UI**: Minimize the playlist and settings panels to focus on the visuals.
*   **Dynamic Starfield**: Toggle a background of thousands of stars for an immersive space-like environment.
*   **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Installable on your device for an app-like experience and offline access.

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Choose Your Audio Source

When you first launch the application, you'll be prompted to select an audio source:
*   **Upload Audio File(s)**: Click to open your file explorer and select one or more audio files. This will create a playlist.
*   **Use Microphone**: Click to use your microphone as the audio input. You will need to grant permission in your browser.

### 2. Playing from Files (Playlist Mode)

If you chose to upload files, a playlist will appear in the top-left corner.

*   **Playing Music**: Click on any track in the playlist to start playing it. Use the playback controls at the bottom of the screen to play, pause, skip, seek, and adjust the volume.
*   **Managing the Playlist**:
    *   **Add Songs**: Click the `+` button in the playlist header to add more files.
    *   **Remove a Song**: Hover over a track and click the trash can icon that appears.
    *   **Reorder Songs**: Click and hold a track, then drag it to a new position in the list.
    *   **Minimize Playlist**: Click the playlist header or the chevron icon to collapse and expand the track list.

### 3. Interacting with the Visualizer

*   **Rotate**: Left-click and drag your mouse to orbit the camera around the sphere.
*   **Zoom**: Use your mouse scroll wheel to zoom in and out.
*   **Pan**: Right-click and drag to pan the camera.

### 4. Customizing the Visuals

1.  Click the **Settings icon** (‚öôÔ∏è) in the top-right corner to open the settings panel.
2.  Use the sliders and dropdowns to adjust the visual parameters in real-time.
3.  Click the **Close icon** (X) or the settings icon again to hide the panel.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
*   **3D Rendering**: Three.js
*   **Audio Processing**: Web Audio API
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

## üîß Running Locally

To run this project on your local machine, you need a simple web server to serve the files. Opening the `index.html` file directly in your browser (`file://...`) will not work due to browser security policies (CORS).

Here are a few easy ways to start a local server on macOS or Windows:

### Option 1: Using Node.js (Recommended)

This is the simplest method if you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

1.  Open your terminal (Terminal on macOS, Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows).
2.  Navigate to the project's root directory (the one containing `index.html`).
3.  Run the following command:
    ```bash
    npx serve
    ```
4.  The server will start and give you a local URL, usually `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your web browser.

### Option 2: Using Python

If you have Python installed, you can use its built-in web server.

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the project's root directory.
3.  Run the command for your Python version:

    *   **Python 3 (macOS and Windows):**
        ```bash
        python -m http.server
        ```
    *   **If the above doesn't work, you may have an older Python 2:**
        ```bash
        python -m SimpleHTTPServer
        ```
4.  The server will start, typically on `http://localhost:8000`. Open this URL in your web browser.

### Option 3: Using VS Code Live Server Extension

If you are using Visual Studio Code as your editor:

1.  Install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension from the VS Code Marketplace.
2.  Open the project folder in VS Code.
3.  Right-click on the `index.html` file in the explorer panel and select "Open with Live Server".
4.  Your browser will automatically open with the project running.
